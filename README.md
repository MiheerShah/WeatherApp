# WeatherApp


This README file provides a brief overview of the Weather App, which is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The Weather App allows users to check the current weather conditions of a specific location by providing the city name or ZIP code. It utilizes a weather API to fetch real-time weather data and presents it in a user-friendly interface.

Getting Started
To run the Weather App on your local machine, follow these steps:

Clone or download the repository to your computer.
Open the project directory in a code editor of your choice.
Prerequisites
You need the following to run the Weather App:

A modern web browser (e.g., Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Safari)
Internet access to fetch weather data from the API.
Usage
Open the index.html file in your web browser.
Enter the name of the city or ZIP code of the location you want to check the weather for.
Click the "Search" button or press Enter.
The app will fetch the weather data for the specified location and display it on the screen.
Technologies Used
The Weather App is built using the following technologies:

HTML: The structure and layout of the app.
CSS: Styling and design of the app interface.
JavaScript: Fetching data from the weather API and updating the UI.
Weather API
The app uses a weather API to obtain real-time weather data for the specified location. The API key is required to access the data. Ensure that the API key is correctly set in the JavaScript file (script.js) before running the app. For testing purposes, you can use a free weather API, but it's recommended to use a paid and more reliable API for a production environment.
